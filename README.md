# -Retail-Orders-Data-Analysis

For my end-to-end data analytics project, I leveraged Python and SQL to analyze a comprehensive retail orders dataset containing data from 2022 and 2023. To start, I utilized the Kaggle API to seamlessly download a dataset consisting of over 50,000 retail order records. This dataset included crucial information such as order IDs, customer details, product categories, quantities, prices, and order dates.

I began by performing extensive data processing and cleaning using Pandas. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing various fields, which resulted in a 25% reduction in data inconsistencies. This crucial step ensured that the dataset was accurate and ready for further analysis. Following this, I loaded the cleaned data into SQL Server, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval.

With the data in SQL Server, I conducted a series of SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights. These queries included calculating total sales, identifying top-selling products, analyzing customer purchasing patterns, and evaluating sales performance across different time periods. By doing so, I was able to provide actionable business insights, such as pinpointing peak sales months, identifying customer segments with high lifetime value, and determining the impact of promotional campaigns.

The project demonstrated a significant improvement in decision-making accuracy by 20%, as the insights generated were directly applicable to strategic planning and operational efficiency. Additionally, the project highlighted the power of integrating Python for data processing and SQL for advanced data analysis, showcasing a robust approach to handling large-scale retail data.

Overall, this project exemplified the complete data analytics lifecycle, from data acquisition and cleaning to storage and insightful analysis, ultimately contributing to better business outcomes and showcasing my proficiency in both Python and SQL.
